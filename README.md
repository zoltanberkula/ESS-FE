## Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [ReactJS]
- [NodeJS]
- [GCP]
- [Firestore]
- [CloudFunctions]
- [Docker]
- [RaspberryPi]
- [MQTT]
- [ModbusRTU]

## Installation

Dillinger requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v10+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
cd ess-fe
npm install
npm start
```

## Docker

```sh
cd ess-fe
docker build -t <youruser>/ess-fe:${package.json.version} .
```

Once done, run the Docker image and map the port to whatever you wish on
your host. In this example, we simply map port 8000 of the host to
port 8080 of the Docker (or whatever port was exposed in the Dockerfile):

```sh
docker run -d -p 8000:8080 --restart=always --cap-add=SYS_ADMIN --name=ess-fe <youruser>/ess-fe:${package.json.version}
```

> Note: `--capt-add=SYS-ADMIN` is required for PDF rendering.

Verify the deployment by navigating to your server address in
your preferred browser.

```sh
127.0.0.1:8000
```
